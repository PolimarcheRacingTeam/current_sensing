This is a library for the current sensor used in sBMS v1.0 for Peacock FSAE car of Polimarche Racing Team
Available in: https://github.com/PolimarcheRacingTeam/current_sensing

Designed specifically to work with the sBMS v1.0 Breakout board

These library provide methods to use the current sensors available on the sBMS v1.0 Breakout board
All the sensors uses two analog reading:
-pin A0 => current sensor reference signal 
-pin A1 => current sensor output signal 

The current sensors available on the board are: 
-LEM HAIS 50-P (range -150 A / +150 A, resolution 0.39 A). This is working now.
-Current Sensor Amplifier Texas Instruments INA170 (range -11.36 A / +11.36 A, resolution 22.19 mA). Not yet implemented.
-External connector (to define external sensors). Not yet implemented.

Polimarche Racing Team invests time and resources providing this open source code, 
please support Polimarche Racing Team and open-source hardware.
